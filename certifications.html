  <body> I took part in Competition Which held at my college (27 April,2023 - 2 May,2023). All th branches students took part in this Competition
    and around 70 students gave their name. Very first day the topic was as per the desire of the participants and were given about 3 mintutes to speak.
     Seven group were made where each group consist of 10 member.Then the judges selected 6 member
     for every group and rest were eliminated and then various round took place lastly only 10 students were left.
     it was a tough Competition. Then among the 10 member the topics were given at random
     which need time, knowledge and calm behaviour to speak continuously and efficiently.
     Topics like power, digital currency etc. were given by the judges at random.
     Everyone tried their best to speak well. I also tried well to speak effectively.
     finally we all gave our best .
     It was 2 May 2023 when the result was to be announced, i was taking deep breath and my heart was pumping very rapidly and finally
     the third position was announced which was not me. When second position guesses were made everyone
     took my name, it was a great moment when audience take your name in terms of victory. Finally second positon name was announced and that was me.
     I was so happy that i can't share my inner feelings.
